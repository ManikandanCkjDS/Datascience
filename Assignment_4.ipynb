    "1.\tWhat exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Empty List Value, List value that contains no items. Similar to empty string value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tIn a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: spam[2] = 'hello' //Index is 2 because first index is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tWhat is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 'd' //'3' * 2 is the string '33', which is passed to int() before being divided by 11. This eventually evaluates to 3. Expressions can be used wherever values are used.//\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tWhat is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 'd'  //Negative index count from the end.\n",

    "Ans : ['a', 'b'] Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\tWhat is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "Ans: 1\n",
    "7.\tHow does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\tHow does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]\n",
    "\n",
    "9.\tWhat are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  List concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.\tWhat is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "Append (): Add values only to the end of a list.\n",
    "Insert ():  Anywhere in the list will add.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.\tWhat are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  1. Del 2. Remove()\n",
    "\n",
    "12.\tDescribe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Both lists and strings can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators\n",
    "\n",
    "13.\tWhat's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  Lists are mutable; they can have values added, removed, or changed. Tuples are immutable; they cannot be changed at all. Also, tuples are written using parentheses,              (and ), while lists use the square brackets, [ and ].\n",
    "\n",
    "14.\tHow do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: (42,).\n",
    "\n",
    "15.\tHow do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: tuple() and list() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "16.\tVariables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Contain references to list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17.\tHow do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy of a list. That is, only copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the list."
