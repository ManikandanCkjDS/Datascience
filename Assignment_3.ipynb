    "1.  Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : Functions reduce the need for duplicate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when\n",
    "    it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : Function executes when the function is called, not when the\n",
    "function is defined\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : The **def** statement defines i.e **“creates”** a function.\n",

    "1.  How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local\n",
    "    scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :**  One global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a\n",
    "function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call\n",
    "    returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :** Function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the\n",
    "variables in it are forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a\n",
    "    return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Ans :** Value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a\n",
    "> return value can be used as part of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return\n",
    "    value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Ans :** If there is no return statement for a function, its return\n",
    "> value is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Ans :** A global statement will be a variable in a function to refer\n",
    "> to the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :** None is NoneType.\n",

    "1.  What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Ans :** Import statement imports a module named\n",
    "> areallyourpetsnamederic. This isn't a real Python module, by the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call\n",
    "    it after importing spam?\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters\n",
    "    an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Ans:** Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try\n",
    "> clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the\n",
    "    except clause?\n",
    "\n",

    ">\n",
    "> **Try clause** - The code that could potentially cause an error goes\n",

    ">\n",
    "> **Except clause** - The code that executes if an error happens goes in\n",
